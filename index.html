       <h1>WELSH TERRIER</h1>
      <H5>The Welsh Terrier (Welsh: Daeargi Cymreig) originates from Wales and was originally bred for hunting fox, rodents and
      badger,[1] but during the last century it has mainly been bred for showing. Despite this, it has retained its terrier
      strength of character. The Welsh Terrier has been claimed to be the oldest existing dog breed in the UK according to
      research.</H5>
